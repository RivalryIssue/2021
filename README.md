# Setup

Clone this repository, download `auth.json` file
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RTFhJ6MHC7nGNg3CtxiAAhgwd3-GBQwo),
and edit the Google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XmFZiYvibdgY58KFkqdgNV55iVbRF3jfKW6Yo0kKyPU/edit)
For the react team, you want to edit the `template/index.html` to include your
react project and edit the javascript in `src`. Don't touch the `index.html` in
`src`! That's automatically generated by the `template`.

Finally, everything is bundled together with [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/).
You _might_ need to do some configuration for react, but I kind of doubt it...
